Make a production build
    -> deploy to rpi

Handle large workouts
    change font size depending on number of lines?

Checkbox to decide which coaches to show
    disabled default?

Create config page
    Any config for workout pane?

Add general options to config
    Page timer
    Background color
    more?

Link to config on main page?
    Only show on mouse movement/hover?

Consider moving timer method to a more general location
Make general getData method

Consider how often data is fetched

No reason to get all coaches to display one coach
    (backend will need to support this /coach?id=...)

Look into pagination on SugarWod
