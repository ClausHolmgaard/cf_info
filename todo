Create config page
    Any config for workout pane?
    Can set/remove/edit multiple info pages
    Can edit coach info

Backend can save info
    Very simple local database at first
        json-server


Consider moving timer method to a more general location
Make general getData method

Consider how often data is fetched

No reason to get all coaches to display one coach
    (backend will need to support this /coach?id=...)

Look into pagination on SugarWod
